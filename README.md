âŒ¨ I am passionate about programming because of its ability to create solutions from scratch, to transform abstract ideas into functional applications, and to unravel complex challenges through algorithms and logic.

ðŸ“– I consider myself self-taught because I find independent learning to be an exciting way to acquire new knowledge and skills, exploring my interests at my own pace and delving into areas that truly inspire me.

ðŸ“º Programming is the art of turning imagination into reality through the language of machines, a creative dance where each line of code is a step towards the realization of ideas and solutions.
